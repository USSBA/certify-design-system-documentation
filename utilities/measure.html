  <h1>Measure</h1>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/USSBA/cds-gem-prototype/blob/master/assets/stylesheets/utilities/_measure.scss">CSS file</a></p>

  <p>Line length, also called "measure", is an important part of readability.</p>

  <p>The design system includes 3 measure modifiers:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>narrow</strong> = line length ~45 characters</li>
    <li><strong>base</strong> = line length ~65 characters</li>
    <li><strong>wide</strong> = line length ~80 characters</li>
  </ul>
