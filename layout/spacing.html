  <h1>Spacing</h1>

  <p>The design system uses multiples of 8px for all spacing values: dimensions, padding, and margins. The goal behind this is to achieve a consistent vertical rhythm and to reduce the cognitive load of fiddling with different spacing options.</p>

  <h2>Sass / CSS</h2>
  <p>When applying padding and margin to elements and components, rather than entering hard coding, use the <code>$multiple</code> variable, which is equivalent to <code>8px</code>. You can use basic math in Sass to keep the rhythm consistent.</p>

  <pre><code class="language-css">.sba-c-some-component {
    padding: $multiple;
    margin-bottom: $multiple * 2;
}</code></pre>

  <h2>Usage</h2>

  <p>Use the margin and padding utility classes to change a UI's spacing. These utility classes are named in a way that allows you to use the modifier to calculate the amount of spacing. For example, a margin utility class that adds 16px of spacing would be <code>sba-u-margin--2</code>. We can calculate this by looking at the class's modifier (2) and multiplying that by our multiple: 2 × 8px = 16px</p>

  <p>If you've imported the design system's Sass file, you can also use the spacer Sass variables, which follow the format $spacer-* where * is a number between 1–7 (i.e. $spacer-4)</p>
