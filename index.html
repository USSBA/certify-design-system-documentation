  <h1>Certify Design System</h1>
  <p class="usa-font-lead">Welcome to the certify.SBA.gov design system. Here you will find guidance on components used in the certify.SBV.gov application. These components are built with the <a href="http://standards.usa.gov/">U.S. Web Design Standards</a>. The design system was heavily influenced by <a href="https://design.cms.gov">design.cms.gov</a></p>

  <p>The design system is created to be used simultaneously with legacy systems. For instance, you may still use components and features that are built with the U.S. Web Design Standards and existing Certify components. The goal is to get all defined platform components into the design system. Once those items are properly incorporated, their legacy versions may be removed as well as any corresponding code. This is expected to happen gradually. </p>

  <h2>Naming conventions</h2>

  <p>The certify.SBA.gov design system uses a strict naming convention. This helps identify what is part of the design system, what role it plays, and what it pertains to.</p>

  <div class="sg-format-example">
    <div class="sg-format-example__row">
      <code aria-describedby="namespace">sba-</code>
      <code aria-describedby="prefix">u-</code>
      <code aria-describedby="bem">item--modifier</code>
    </div>
    <div class="sg-format-example__row">
      <div id="namespace">Namespace</div>
      <div id="prefix">Prefix</div>
      <div id="bem">BEM syntax</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Every part of the design system must be name-spaced with <code>sba-</code>, prefixed with its role, and a <a href="http://getbem.com/naming/">BEM syntax</a> convention.</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Prefix</th>
        <th scope="col">Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row"><code>l-</code></th>
        <td>Indicates layout, generally for building the grid.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row"><code>c-</code></th>
        <td>Indicates a component. Components are built specific to the needs of certify.SBA.gov</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row"><code>u-</code></th>
        <td>Indicates a utility. Utilities pertain to CSS properties.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>These prefixes can sometimes be followed by a "breakpoint prefix".</p>

  <h2>About using the design system</h2>

  <p>The design system provides a large amount of flexibility for prototype and development for production. At the moment, the design system is constructed in Jekyll, but will eventually be packaged as a gem and a node module.</p>

  <h3>Contributing</h3>
