        <h1>Full initial review prototype</h1>
<p class="usa-font-lead">This is a full walkthrough of the analyst review. It will include business logic for the taskbar, changing status, and more. See below for details.</p>

<p><em>Note: Return to this page to clear session data.</em></p>

<h2>About this prototype</h2>

<p>We are starting to get into the creation of reusable components. Some of those are beginning to be documented in a <a href="/styleguide">styleguide</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the three dots in the taskbar to see the task panel.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to perform any tasks available to a specific application status, the status must be changed.</p>

<h3>Notes for Certify Team</h3>

<h4>The Task Bar (AKA Fun Bar)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The task bar will be sticky when the user scrolls to it. </li>
  <li>The options in the fun bar will be different depending on the status of the application and the role of the user.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ad Hoc Reviews</h4>
<p>Ad Hoc Reviews are only available to applications that are in processing, so you'll need to change the status before you see the link.</p>
<p>To initiate an ad hoc review, either select "Request info from firm" from the task panel or go to the additional info section at the bottom of the application overview.</p>

<p>Next, the analyst will use a form to request info.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All fields are required</li>
  <li>At least one checkbox must be checked.</li>
  <li>The cancel button will return user to previous page</li>
</ul>

<p>After the request is submitted, a new card will be created. New cards will be created for each ad hoc request, with the latest card appearing first.</p>


<h2>Firm Withdraws a case</h2>

<p>A firm may choose to withdraw a case. When that happens, an alert message will appear on the top of the application view in the masthead. To view the alert, you must apply this URL parameter: <code>withdrawal=true</code></p>

<p><a href="application.html?withdrawal=true">View the application when a vendor withdraws.</a></p>
